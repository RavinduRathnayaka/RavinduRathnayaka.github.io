In our rapidly evolving technological world, the standard of living continues to rise, with transportation playing a vital role in our daily lives. However, Sri Lanka faces a higher rate of road accidents due to factors like speeding, drunk driving, and traffic violations. To mitigate these incidents and save lives, the ASAP Caller project focuses on reducing fatalities. This device swiftly sends alerts to emergency services, addressing critical situations and minimizing the time gap between accidents and medical response, ultimately decreasing the number of road accident-related deaths.
