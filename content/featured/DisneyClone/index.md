In today's tech-driven world, the Internet of Things (IoT) has become a ubiquitous part of daily life, connecting devices and sensors in a web of data-sharing. This project focuses on a Home Security System, where a central hub coordinates various sensors, surveillance cameras, and a control panel to safeguard homes. Sensors on doors and windows detect activity, while facial recognition cameras identify individuals entering the premises. The system sends real-time notifications to homeowners through a mobile app, enhancing security and providing peace of mind. It's a prime example of how IoT technology is transforming and enhancing our everyday lives.
